### An implentation of RWANDA local security fees(IRONDO) in C|üí∞

In Rwanda we normally pay a monthly fee in our respective villages for Security, this amount is usuallly used to pay the local force that looks after us or pay for damages where something is stolen.
I made this system for admins, just to keep track of how each citizen pays their monthly fee.
